        v.1.03 - Added 'onlyNonPremium' configurable.
                 Removed modlib, since the script is run once anyway we don't need it loaded at all times.
                 It shouldn't now stop execution when a house is nameless.
				
		v.1.02 - now uses only one sql query, removed multiworld configurable  since it's not needed anymore
        v.1.01 - small fixes, optimized query + multiworld support.
       
		
        This mod will clean houses of inactive players and move their items to the depot.
        
        config explained:
            
            days - If the player hasn't logged in for this number of days his house will be freed.
            log - true/false, whether to enable logging of which houses have been cleaned.
            file - path to the log file, where logs will be stored. Ignored if 'log' set to false
            onlyNonPremium - if set to 'true', the script will clean only the houses of players who don't have any pacc days left.
			
		other notes:
			DO NOT remove doSaveServer() at the end, otherwise if your server happens to crash before the nearest server save you will regret it =)
